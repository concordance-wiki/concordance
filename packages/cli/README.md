# @concordance-wiki/cli

The `concordance` command (alias `conc`).

| Command | Effect | Exit codes |
|---|---|---|
| `validate-config [--config file]` | validates the configuration and reports every problem with its path, received value and expectation | 0 valid, 1 invalid, 2 file not found |
| `init [directory]` | writes a minimal, commented `concordance.yaml`; never overwrites | 0 written, 2 exists |
| `build [--config file]` | validates the configuration, then runs the pipeline | 1 invalid configuration; the later steps are not implemented yet |
